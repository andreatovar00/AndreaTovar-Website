        <div class="subheading mb-5">Food Justice</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Food has been an important part of my life from childhood to my adulthood. I see the effects that food and health can have on one's life. From a young age, I was inspired by my older siblings to lead a healthier lifestyle. Once I decided to create a major lifestyle difference of eating a plant-based diet, I felt empowered to share my knowledge of the positive effects of this decision. As  a result, I recently had an internship where I was able to cook for a program, College Track. College Track is a nonprofit organization in my neighborhood, East Palo Alto, where students receive funds for their college experience depending on the amount of time and effort they put into their studies and community service while in College Track. At College Track this past summer, I created a menu for the incoming freshmen and helped to create these meals for two weeks. To finalize my internship, I created a workshop in which the students learned about food deserts and how to navigate healthy eating in underserved communities. My internship was an amazing experience as it has taught me how to uplift and empower my community to lead a healthier lifestyle. It also taught me the amount of power and influence that youth can hold in our future. It was rewarding to see the amount of growth in my students at College Track.

I want to continue inspiring people and opening the minds of others which is why I am now part of the R'Pantry on campus. The R'Pantry is an emergency food resource center where students can receive up to ten weekly points to get food. Since working at the R'Pantry this year, I have opened my eyes to the fact that individuals of all ages can struggle with food insecurity. Also, I have realized that poor habits can carry on to individuals' adult life or begin in college alone. For this reason, I try my best to inspire to eat healthier by posting up recipes and healthy eating tips on our bulletin boards. I hope to expand my knowledge on food to further help students learn how to cook healthy, delicious, filling, and energizing food. 

I am grateful for these experiences which have allowed me to grow my knowledge and perspective that many individuals experience. I hope to continue to grow as an individual and share my knowledge and experience in food justice with others. I am aware that people experience many struggles, however, food is basic need that nobody should struggle with. Food is powerful as it can either kill you slowly or energize and fuel you for the day. It is important to see food as a source of energy and treat it as such. I hope to continue sharing my knowledge on the healing and beneficial effects of healthy eating. <br><br>
